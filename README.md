# Automatic-Plate-Recognition-System-Using-KNN

Automatic number-plate recognition is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location data.
Uniqueness or individuality of a vehicle is identified by the vehicle registration number. 
In this project, number on vehicle number plate is used for the purpose of identifying vehicle automatically. 
Vehicle details of the vehicle is very important for every parking area, organizations, universities and every public place.
